While it was tricky at first, a (temporary) hotfix has now been applied. A more in-depth update is coming after 1.0 :smile:</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first contribution</a> in our sprint coming from outside the Uppy team was added by <a href="https://github.com/allenfantasy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeqiu</a>. It concerns events being fired when an uploaded file fails a restriction check. With this feature, it will be a lot easier to know which file has been restricted from upload and why. </p></li><li><p>And the <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second outside contribution</a> comes from <a href="https://github.com/ap--" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreas</a>, who fixed an issue involving the use of both tus and the limit parameter to set a maximum number of parallel uploads. </p></li></ul><p>Big shout out to both!</p><h2 id="In-Progress"><a href="#In-Progress" class="headerlink" title="In Progress"></a>In Progress</h2><ul><li><p>The React Native team has their pairing session at 14:00 today, during which they will work on <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native support</a> for Uppy, <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tus-js-client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/packages/@uppy/companion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Companion</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/arturi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artur</a> will be working on tweaking the React Native UI and dealing with file preview icons for non-image files.

If you look at our <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CHANGELOG</a>, you’ll notice some 1.1 todos in there. There’s always room for improvement, so now you have something to look forward to after Uppy 1.0 hits the web! :wink:</p><p>That’s all from me today.

It’s the beginning of a new week and there is much to be done. The Uppy team is already firing on all cylinders and we also have some developments to share from before the weekend.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Let’s jump right in!</p><center><br><img width="400" src="/images/blog/30daystoliftoff/day14.jpg"><br></center><h2 id="Done"><a href="#Done" class="headerlink" title="Done"></a>Done</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renée</a> finished work on <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceling Transloadit Assemblies</a> when you abort uploads.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/arturi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artur</a> published the <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/845369f0e56b49ab51d4d01909dfdac6f60b1748" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CHANGELOG for 0.30.4</a>, which was a bit more work to figure out now that the whole Transloadit team is piling commits onto <code>master</code> :scream: We also completed a few smaller tasks, such as fixing an issue with our build scripts and updating the Companion docs.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Done-for-React-Native"><a href="#Done-for-React-Native" class="headerlink" title="Done for React Native"></a>Done for React Native</h2><p>This is a pretty big one! <a href="https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ife</a> and Artur delivered on the bare essentials for React Native. In our local tests, this means we can now successfully pick different files, have their uploads resume where they left off, select a remote file via Companion (for now, only picking from URL is supported) and see the progress reported by it. </p><p>There is a basic UI, most of which is encapsulated in the example that we’ll publish on our website. We’re refraining from building too much UI in our React Native module, as we assume that developers will want to have full control and style everything close to their app. We figured they would care most about seeing a good example and having access to core functionality, such as making mobile uploads more reliable and less draining on batteries and data plans. </p><p>While there are still things to be implemented, such as picking files from Instagram, we now know that we have all the Lego bricks required and that they are doing what they’re supposed to. Now, it’s just a matter of fleshing out those integrations, but we’ll have to see whether we can get to that before 1.0. We’re already happy about having a fixed idea about the API and a basic working example as our deliverables!</p><h2 id="In-Progress"><a href="#In-Progress" class="headerlink" title="In Progress"></a>In Progress</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/nqst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> is working on improving the Uppy design (in the code) in his <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/master...nqst:design-facelift" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>design-facelift</code> branch</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/lakesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evgenia</a> is working on improving accessibility together with Alex, who found many issues that we still need to fix in this area.</p></li><li><p>Now that the bare essentials of React Native work, Ife is making sure our local work finds a proper place in the tus-js-client (such as React-Native-compatible fingerprinting) while Artur hopes to find the time to tick off a few design goals to make for a better experience testdriving our example. Things like icons for files that are not images and a <em>Close</em> button for the select file screen.</p></li><li><p>The whole team will again do a call this afternoon to reassess our roadmap and see where all we stand. Some new tasks were added on <a href="/blog/2019/04/liftoff-11/">Friday</a>, so we’ll also have to see about getting those into gear.</p></li></ul><p>That’s it for Day 14. Tomorrow, it will be Samuel’s turn again to update you on our board and progress.

Here’s a list of completed tasks directly from the team:</p><ul><li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox" checked> Make the ‘Import from URL’ example work in RN</li><li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox" checked> Give it its own UI, (re)written for RN</li><li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox" checked> Make websocket progress from Companion work (see: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network#websocket-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network#websocket-support</a>)</li><li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox" checked> Have an example with buttons for resumability and a progress bar</li><li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox" checked> Have 20 min resumability support, proof that fingerprinting works for different local file uploads, fix it if not</li></ul></li><li><p>A <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature</a> was submitted by <a href="https://github.com/superandrew213" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Shini</a> that involving checking for existing uploads before uploading anything, which has been necessary for his custom dashboard.

A big thank you to the open source community for making contributions!</p></li></ul><h2 id="In-Progress"><a href="#In-Progress" class="headerlink" title="In Progress"></a>In Progress</h2><p>Meanwhile, on the progress side of things:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/Kiloreux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abdel</a> has started working on a <a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glitch</a> demo involving Companion, so users can have an even easier time utilizing our services. He’s also working on fixing up the Serverless example (running Companion on AWS Lambda) which was once contributed by the community but hasn’t been workin for a long time :scream:</p></li><li><p>Renée is going to spend the day on getting Transloadit Assemblies to actually cancel when the Cancel button in the UI is pressed. As it stands, the upload cancels, but the Assembly keeps running until it eventually times out by itself.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/tim-kos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim</a> has started working on fixing an API problem that caused one of our end-to-end tests to intermittently fail and eventually turn off entirely. </p></li><li><p>Finally, the React Native team has already completed an impressive amount of tasks, but they aren’t slowing down anytime soon. Development marches on as the team begins tackling the following tasks:</p><ul><li style="list-style: none"><input type="checkbox"> Add basic file preview to react native example.

I’m looking forward to sharing more details on that call soon!</p><p>The first third of our thirty-day challenge ends tomorrow with <a href="/blog/2019/04/liftoff-10/">Day 10</a>.

Here’s day three for you!</p><a id="more"></a><p>We’re still mostly busy tying up any remaining loose ends before April 1, when we’ll really start our coding speedrun towards 1.0:</p><center><img width="400" src="/images/blog/30daystoliftoff/day3.jpg"><br></center><h2 id="Done"><a href="#Done" class="headerlink" title="Done"></a>Done</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/arturi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artur</a> merged two pull requests from <a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renée</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a> one aims to use Transloadit Templates and demo keys for the <code>transloadit-textarea</code> example, and the <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second</a> one makes error reporting across different locales more flexible.</p><p>Artur also added a <a href="/examples/markdown-snippets/">GitHub-comment-inspired demo</a>. Add a file attachment to your markdown, and it will be uploaded and converted to a thumbnail that’s displayed inside your post, no matter the media type (audio turns into artwork, images are resized, videos thumbnailed, etc.). </p><p><a href="https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ife</a> reviewed and merged this <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull request</a>, which updates the callback URIs to reflect their correct location in Companion. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/HughbertD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HughbertD</a> for that one!</p><p>We also celebrated Evgenia submitting her first two PRs: <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one</a> to make sure that tooltips can no longer overflow inside the Uppy container, and <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another</a> that removes the jumpiness when Uppy loads.</p><h2 id="In-Progress"><a href="#In-Progress" class="headerlink" title="In Progress"></a>In Progress</h2><p>Renée is working hard to fix outdated warnings in our examples. Other than that, the team has been dealing with a Companion issue that invalid access tokens are given out when you select a provider to receive your file from. The aim is to return 401 for invalid access tokens, so that the <code>/authorized</code> endpoint can be deprecated. You can track the progress of this issue in its <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull request</a>.</p><center><img src="/images/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-03-27-board02.png"></center><h2 id="To-Do"><a href="#To-Do" class="headerlink" title="To Do"></a>To Do</h2><p>The biggest update that will be part of Uppy 1.0 is support for React Native. Yesterday, Renée, Artur, Ife, <a href="https://github.com/lakesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evgenia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kvz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin</a> had a call and talked extensively about what would be needed to have a minimum viable product. They settled on the following six subtasks, which I’m copying directly from their notes: :)</p><figure class="highlight md"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre>MVP for React Native support should:- [ ] get a link provider example to work, including showing Companion progress and resumability- [ ] get its own UI, (re)written for RN- [ ] make websocket progress from Companion work (see: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network#websocket-support)- [ ] have an example with buttons for resumability & a progress bar- [ ] have resumability support within 20 min (easily tested by disabling WiFi on your workstation while uploading to master.tus.io)- [ ] have an example with basic file previews (Uppy RN itself likely does not offer previews)</pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>That’s all the updates I have for you today. See you tomorrow for <a href="/blog/2019/03/liftoff-04/">Day 4</a> of our 30 Days to Liftoff!</p><p>P.S.

This lets us see in an instant what everyone is working on and what the current status is on specific tasks. </p><p>We currently have our tasks divided into five sections, which are: <em>Nice To Have</em>, <em>To Do</em>, <em>In Progress</em> and <em>Done</em>. The tasks in the <em>To Do</em> and <em>In Progress</em> lanes (and of course those that are <em>Done</em>) are planned to make the 1.0 release. And if we have time on our side before the launch date, we’ll also try to get as many of the <em>Nice To Have</em> tasks checked off as well.</p><p>We’ve discussed our <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changelog</a>‘s 1.0 goals and tried to re-prioritize and assign work. </p><p>We didn’t manage to fit all of those <em>To Do</em>s in the picture, but here is a screenshot of what our board looks like at the moment:</p><center><img src="/images/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-03-27-board02.png"></center><p>Aside from planning, we’ve also been busy onboarding <a href="https://github.com/lakesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evgenia</a> so she can hit the ground running April 1st.</p><p>And tomorrow, we’ll look at the <em>To Do</em>s in more detail, so we can get a clearer idea of subtasks and who will do what, exactly.</p><p>That’s all the updates I have for you today.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we <a href="/blog/2016/07/uppy-begins/">started working on Uppy</a> back in early 2016, all we had was an idea and the shared desire to launch file uploading into a new age. We had already been laying the groundwork with the development of <a href="https://tus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tus.io</a> and felt that its robust back-end deserved a front-end just as robust, modern and user-friendly. </p><a id="more"></a><p>But what about open? We initially thought about building a proprietary uploader that would work exclusively with Transloadit’s commercial service, but we quickly turned around on it. We knew this could have a real impact. So, just like we did with Tus, we decided to make our new project open source. Three years, <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/stargazers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.000 stargazers</a> and a thriving community later — and we could not be happier. Well, apart from one thing: <strong>getting Uppy 1.0 out the door</strong> has proven harder than expected. Issues keep piling up, which led us down countless sidetracks and hurt our capacity to hammer out those final design goals. </p><p>But now it’s time for all that to change. That’s why, starting today, we are allocating all of Transloadit’s resources into making a big final push and getting Uppy ready for liftoff. Our goal is to launch on <strong>April 25</strong>, exactly thirty days from now. </p><center><img width="400" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/kvw01ozJ06TxS/giphy.gif"><br><br></center><p>We’ll need all the help we can get, so for the next thirty days, everyone here at Transloadit is going to be working exclusively on tasks related to Uppy 1.0. That means the Uppy core team (obviously) and tus core team, our SDK teams, as well as our infra &amp; API engineers, designers, content writers, and the founders themselves — we’ll all be chipping in and doing our part to ensure liftoff in thirty days. We’re even adding someone new to the Uppy team in April. A warm welcome to <a href="https://github.com/lakesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evgenia Karunus</a> :)</p><h2 id="A-new-post-every-day"><a href="#A-new-post-every-day" class="headerlink" title="A new post every day"></a>A new post every day</h2><p>We have added all tasks to a project board and thought it might be a fun idea to keep you updated on our day-to-day progress. So, we set ourselves an additional challenge: apart from getting Uppy ready for 1.0, we’re also going to <strong>write a blog post about it every day</strong>, for thirty days. Starting with this one.</p><p>A post each day may prove hard to do, but we think it’s worth a try. It really fits with the open way in which we have been developing Uppy for the past few years, and gives you a look behind the scenes as we’re getting ready for the home stretch. And hopefully, we also succeed in spreading the word even further, reaching people that don’t yet know about Uppy, but would be happy to!</p><h2 id="What’s-Uppy-with-you"><a href="#What’s-Uppy-with-you" class="headerlink" title="What’s Uppy with you?"></a>What’s Uppy with you?</h2><p>We’d love to hear what you think. Whether it is about Uppy in general, or specific issues you feel cannot be forgotten before 1.0, or maybe even about this blog post challenge itself — leave a comment here, use our <a href="https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forum</a> directly (it also hosts the comments), or let us know on Twitter via <a href="http://twitter.com/uppy_io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@uppy_io</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/transloadit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@transloadit</a>. </p><!-- <center><img width="400"  class="dropshadow" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/RnX4q6yYDoYCI/giphy.gif"></center> --><center><img width="400" class="dropshadow" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/SjInxhAJTzU7S/giphy.gif"><br><br></center><p>We can use your help! As we’ve said, we’re looking to spread the word so any retweet, blog post, star, you name it, is gonna be double extra appreciated. Also, <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue busting</a> is going to slow down as we’re about to head deep into the remaining design goals (e.g. React Native). So, if you want to lend a hand with that, we’d owe you big time!</p><p>See you tomorrow for the first progress update on <a href="/blog/2019/03/liftoff-02/">Day 2</a> of our 30 Days to Liftoff!</p><p>PS If you don’t want to miss an update, consider <a href="https://uppy.io/atom.xml">good ol’ RSS</a> :)</p>]]></content>

Transloadit is the Swiss Army Knife for your files: importing, resizing, cropping and watermarking images, making GIFs, transcoding videos, extracting thumbnails, generating audio waveforms, and so much more — all in a single service. Uppy has a similarly large feature set in dozens of plugins, but because of that it can be complicated to wire everything up for the best experience.</p><p><a href="https://uppy.io/docs/robodog/">Robodog</a> is a new Uppy-based library that has been trained to work with Transloadit. It includes three components:</p><ol><li><a href="https://uppy.io/docs/robodog/picker/">File picker</a>, using the Dashboard plugin you know and love for the modal UI, with support for imports from third-party services.</li><li><a href="https://uppy.io/docs/robodog/form/">Form</a>: integration with your existing HTML forms. Files will be uploaded to Transloadit, and the form will submit JSON information about the files and encoding results.</li><li><a href="https://uppy.io/docs/robodog/upload/">Upload</a>: one-line programmatic uploads — call <code>transloadit.upload(files, opts)</code> and get an array of results back.</li></ol><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Eq7T3GwDAlggE/giphy.gif"></center><p>Here’s a demo:</p><figure class="wide"><br>  <p class="codepen" data-height="600" data-theme-id="light" data-border-color="#EB2177" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="uppy" data-slug-hash="gEgPav" style="height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Robodog: resizing and optimizing your avatar"><br>    <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/uppy/pen/gEgPav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br>    Robodog: resizing and optimizing your avatar</a> by Uppy File Uploader (<a href="https://codepen.io/uppy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@uppy</a>)<br>    on <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodePen</a>.</span><br>  </p><br>  <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script><br></figure><p>You can install Robodog from NPM:</p><figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre>npm install @uppy/robodog --save </pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Or import it by using an HTML script tag:</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>link</span> <span class="token attr-name">rel</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>stylesheet<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://transloadit.edgly.net/releases/uppy/v0.30.3/robodog.min.css<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://transloadit.edgly.net/releases/uppy/v0.30.3/robodog.min.js<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token script language-javascript"></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></pre></td></tr></table></figure><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MqGA1Za9ar6lG/giphy.gif"></center><h2 id="Dashboard-Improvements"><a href="#Dashboard-Improvements" class="headerlink" title="Dashboard Improvements"></a>Dashboard Improvements</h2><p>As usual, we are making constant iterations and improvements to the Dashboard plugin.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/0.29/uppy-core-plugins-separate-styles.jpg"></p><p><code>0.29</code> brings bug fixes and improvements, while we are busy working on Uppy React Native support (which first had to <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client#react-native-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">land in the js client for our resumable file upload protocol: tus.io</a>) and a Preset (still debating the name) which will make it easier to leverage Transloadit’s encoding platform, and offer a smooth migration path for users not yet on Uppy. The highlights of this release are: separating Core and Plugin styles, more accurate progress reporting by factoring in sizes across files, adding a <code>responseType</code> option for XHR Upload, and fixing visual Webcam bugs.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Separate-Core-and-Plugin-styles"><a href="#Separate-Core-and-Plugin-styles" class="headerlink" title="Separate Core and Plugin styles"></a>Separate Core and Plugin styles</h2><p><strong>⚠️ breaking</strong></p><p>When installing <code>uppy</code> and Plugins from npm, you had to include their styles. Prior to this release, you only had to include the Plugin’s CSS, say, for <code>@uppy/webcam</code>:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="token keyword">import</span> Uppy <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/core'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> Webcam <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/webcam'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css'</span></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Each plugin’s file contained the Core styles. If you added multiple plugins, the core styles ended up being duplicated. This bloated file sizes and could even break styles entirely because of CSS’s precedence rules.</p><p>Now, you have to include “general” styles from <code>@uppy/core</code> as well:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="token keyword">import</span> Uppy <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/core'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> Webcam <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/webcam'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/core/dist/style.css'</span> <span class="token comment">// &lt;-- add this separately and one time only</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css'</span></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Thus, the Core styles are only included once. <code>@uppy/core</code> styles must be included before Plugin styles.</p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uppy.io/docs/plugins/">documentation</a> for the Plugin you are using to find out whether it requires a CSS file to work. Generally speaking, UI plugins, such as the Dashboard, Webcam and Status Bar, need a CSS file, while utility plugins, such as Tus or XHR Upload, don’t.</p><p>⚠️ Important things to remember:</p><ol><li>Dashboard is a universal UI that comes with the Status Bar and Informer Plugins built in, and as such, Dashboard styles already come with the Informer and Status Bar styles.</li><li>Dashboard also ships with “Remote Provider” styles — you don’t need to include anything besides <code>@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css</code> for Google Drive, Instagram and Dropbox to work. However, the Url and Webcam plugins still have to be included manually. Here’s an example:</li></ol><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="token keyword">import</span> Uppy <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/core'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> Dashboard <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/webcam'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> GoogleDrive <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/google-drive'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> Webcam <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/webcam'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> Url <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/url'</span><span class="token comment">// Core and Dashboard styles, then Webcam and Url, but not for GoogleDrive —</span><span class="token comment">// those come with Dashboard</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/core/dist/style.css'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css'</span><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token string">'@uppy/url/dist/style.css'</span></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Using-File-Sizes-For-Progress-Calculation"><a href="#Using-File-Sizes-For-Progress-Calculation" class="headerlink" title="Using File Sizes For Progress Calculation"></a>Using File Sizes For Progress Calculation</h2><p>When possible, file sizes are now used for calculating the total progress. Before, we’ve used uploaded percentage for each file. Meaning that if you were uploading four files — and three small were already uploaded, while one very large file was still in progress — Uppy might still display progress as being 90%. Long story short, Uppy now has a more accurate progress bar 🚀</p><p>Some internal details, if you are interested:</p><ol><li>If there are files without sizes, the average size of all other files is assumed for the unsized files.</li><li>If there are no files with sizes, the percentage is just based on the percentages of the unsized files.</li></ol><p><img src="/images/blog/0.29/progress-size-calculation.jpg"></p><h2 id="responseType-For-XHR-Upload"><a href="#responseType-For-XHR-Upload" class="headerlink" title="responseType For XHR Upload"></a><code>responseType</code> For XHR Upload</h2><p>When using XHR Upload, you can now configure the XMLHttpRequest <code>.responseType</code> value. This allows the S3 Plugin to tell Firefox not to log XML errors when getting empty responses, so it finally fixes the spurious warnings that were caused by this, see <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/518" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#518</a>.</p><p>Because AwsS3 now sets <code>responseType</code>: <code>&#39;text&#39;</code>, we can no longer use the <code>responseXML</code> property. We already did text based parsing for successful responses, and will now do the same for error responses.</p><h2 id="Misc-Changes"><a href="#Misc-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Misc Changes"></a>Misc Changes</h2><ul><li>@uppy/core: Don’t pass removed file IDs to next upload step, fixes (#1148 / @goto-bus-stop)</li><li>@uppy/core: Fixed getFileType() when passed a file with an uppercase extension (#1169 / @jderrough)</li><li>@uppy/companion: Use <code>createCipheriv</code> instead of deprecated <code>createCipher</code> (#1149 / @goto-bus-stop)</li><li>@uppy/companion: Store Provider instances on <code>this.provider</code> instead of <code>this[this.id]</code> (@goto-bus-stop / #1174)</li><li>@uppy/companion: Pin grant to known stable version (@ifedapoolarewaju / #1165)</li><li>@uppy/companion: Fix — socket does not handle server.path option (#1142 / @tranvansang)</li><li>@uppy/webcam: Fix a bug with Webcam video overflowing its container (68730f8a1bf731898d46883e00fed937d3ab54ab / @arturi)</li><li>docs: Add <code>triggerUploadOnSubmit</code> to Form docs, add docs about options of hiding upload/pause/resume/cancel buttons; talk about bundler-less polyfill use (@goto-bus-stop, @arturi)</li><li>@uppy/react: Allow Dashboard props width and height to accept a string for 100% (#1129 / craigcbrunner)</li></ul><p>See the <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full changelog (0.29)</a> for more details.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Uppy 0.28: A look behind the scenes</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="border" src="/images/blog/0.28/dashboard-uploading.jpg"></p><p>In <code>0.28</code>, we are introducing a new “Single Upload” mode, improving on the Status Bar plugin with a spinner and different pause/resume/cancel buttons. We’ll also share some progress on bringing back unified locale packs and a Transloadit Preset 🍁</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Single-Uploads"><a href="#Single-Uploads" class="headerlink" title="Single Uploads"></a>Single Uploads</h2><p>Uppy has been flexible about uploading lots of things from the start. You can add files at any time, even after uploads have already started. This is neat, but not always the desired behaviour: sometimes, you just want to upload a few files together with a form. In that case, it’s useful to allow users to only upload a set of files <em>once</em>. 0.28.0 adds some options to help with that!</p><p>An upload in Uppy terminology can be more than one file. Users can add a bunch of files and when they press “Upload”, all those files are bunched up into an upload. They can then add more files and press the “Upload” button again: the <em>new</em> files are bunched into a second upload.</p><p>The new <a href="https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#allowMultipleUploads-true"><code>allowMultipleUploads</code></a> option in Uppy Core can be set to <code>false</code> to only allow a single one of those uploads. Once an upload is started, the Dashboard and Status Bar no longer show “add files” and “upload” buttons. You can listen for a ‘complete’ event and then safely continue your app’s form flow.</p><p>The Dashboard also has a new option: <a href="https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#closeAfterFinish-false"><code>closeAfterFinish</code></a>. When <code>true</code>, the modal Dashboard will automatically hide once an upload has completed. You should only use this option in conjunction with <code>allowMultipleUploads</code>, otherwise it might close the Dashboard when the user isn’t done yet! It can only be used with the modal Dashboard, when <a href="https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#inline-false"><code>inline</code></a> is set to <code>false</code>. “Closing” an inline Dashboard makes no sense :smile: You will see a warning in the console in both cases, so you don’t have to remember all that.</p><p>Speaking of the Dashboard, it now also shows more statuses in the title bar: “Upload complete”, “Upload paused”, “Processing 5 files” and “Uploading 5 files”.</p><h2 id="Status-Bar-improvements"><a href="#Status-Bar-improvements" class="headerlink" title="Status Bar improvements"></a>Status Bar improvements</h2><ul><li>⚠️ <strong>breaking</strong> We’ve added separate options for hiding pause/resume and cancel buttons. So now there are several options for buttons: <code>hideUploadButton</code>, <code>hideRetryButton</code>, <code>hidePauseResumeButton</code> and <code>hideCancelButton</code>. These options can be passed from the Dashboard, if you are not using Status Bar separately (most common case). See the docs for more info: <a href="https://uppy.io/docs/status-bar/">https://uppy.io/docs/status-bar/</a>.</li><li>The Status Bar now features a spinner animation when upload is in progress.</li><li>Encoding (with the Transloadit plugin, for example) and uploading progress now get different colors, so it’s easier to tell what’s happening, visually.</li></ul><p><img class="border" style="border-top: 0;" src="/images/blog/0.28/status-bar-uploading.png"></p><p><img class="border" style="border-top: 0;" src="/images/blog/0.28/status-bar-paused.png"></p><p><img class="border" style="border-top: 0;" src="/images/blog/0.28/status-bar-encoding.png"></p><p><img class="border" style="border-top: 0;" src="/images/blog/0.28/status-bar-complete.png"></p><h2 id="Locale-packs"><a href="#Locale-packs" class="headerlink" title="Locale packs"></a>Locale packs</h2><p>In the beginning, we used to have unified locale packs for text strings in Uppy — English, Russian, German, Polish, etc. Then we made a switch to per-plugin locales, and the ability to load one file with locale strings in any language (locale pack) was lost for a while. This release is the first step in bringing this functionality back.</p><p>With this change, you can load a locale pack like so: <code>const uppy = Uppy({locale: german})</code>, then still override specific strings in a certain plugin, if needed:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="token keyword">const</span> uppy <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">Uppy</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>locale<span class="token punctuation">:</span> german<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>uppy<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">use</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>Dashboard<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>  trigger<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#pick-files'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>  locale<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>    strings<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>      dropPasteImport<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'Something else here, %{browse} or this'</span>    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The benefit to this is that there will be a central point of configuration for languages, so there could be language packs with strings for, e.g., Czech at @uppy/lang-cz (or @uppy/langs/cz) that would be very easy to contribute to (or use).</p><p>After Uppy 0.28.0, this functionality is technically possible, but we still need to update and publish locale packs for multiple languages.</p><h2 id="Hosted-Companion-with-Transloadit"><a href="#Hosted-Companion-with-Transloadit" class="headerlink" title="Hosted Companion with Transloadit"></a>Hosted Companion with Transloadit</h2><p>When using remote providers such as Google Drive and Dropbox, so that your users can pick files from these sources, you can host <a href="https://uppy.io/docs/companion/">Companion</a> yourself, or use the one provided by Transloadit.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;0.28&lt;/code&gt;, we are introducing a new “Single Upload” mode, improving on the Status Bar plugin with a spinner and different pause/resume/cancel buttons. We’ll also share some progress on bringing back unified locale packs and a Transloadit Preset 🍁&lt;/p&gt;
